# Authentication vs. Authorization
###### 11.10.25
As I explore the insides of wireless networking, authentication and authorization topics often come up, especially in setups involving WiFi and access points (that I usually work with), the RADIUS protocol, and tools like **freeRADIUS**. These terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but they serve distinct roles in securing and managing network access. In this post, I'll break it down step by step, with a focus on WiFi environments, let's start by explaining AAA, the framework that ties it all together.

### What is AAA?

AAA stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting, a core framework in network security that ensures users are verified, granted appropriate access, and their activities are tracked. It's like a three-layered checkpoint system for any network resource.

- **Authentication** is what verifies who you are.
- **Authorization** determines what you can do once verified.
- **Accounting** is responsible for logging actions for auditing, billing, or troubleshooting. Think of it as the record-keeper that tracks session start times, data usage, and logout events.

AAA originated in the days of dial-up internet but has evolved to support modern protocols like RADIUS. In WiFi contexts, AAA is implemented through standards like IEEE 802.1X, where access points enforce these controls. FreeRADIUS, an open-source RADIUS server, is a popular tool for handling AAA, integrating with databases like SQL or LDAP to manage user credentials and policies.

### First A - verifying identity

In WiFi networks, this process is crucial to prevent unauthorized connections. For enterprise setups using WPA2/3-Enterprise, authentication relies on the RADIUS protocol. Here's how it typically works:

- A user connects to a WiFi access point (AP) and provides credentials, such as a username/password or certificate.
- The AP forwards these to a RADIUS server via an EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) method like PEAP or EAP-TLS.
- The server checks against a backend database. If the credentials match, it sends an "Access-Accept" response; otherwise, "Access-Reject."

This step focuses purely on identity verification, so no decisions about privileges yet. For beginners, think of it as logging into an email account: you prove it's you with a password, but what folders or features you access comes next.

### Second A - grantitng permissions

After verifying identity, the RADIUS server returns attributes (like VLAN assignments, bandwidth limits, or session timeouts) to the access point. For example:

- A guest might be authorized for basic internet access on a isolated VLAN.
- An employee could get full network access with higher speeds.
- FreeRADIUS excels here, allowing admins to define these rules via configuration files or dynamic queries to external systems.

Authorization prevents over-privileging, reducing risks like data breaches. It's policy-driven and can be fine-tuned (e.g., IoT devices limited to specific ports).

### Now together

In a typical WiFi setup, authentication and authorization flow seamlessly:

1. A device associates with the AP and initiates an 802.1X handshake.
2. Authentication occurs: Credentials are sent for validation.
3. If successful, authorization attributes are applied. The AP enforces them, perhaps assigning the device to a VLAN or applying QoS (Quality of Service) rules.
4. Accounting kicks in: The AP logs the session to the RADIUS server for monitoring.

### Why it matters

Understanding these simple terms helps to avoid common pitfalls, like weak verification leading to spoofing attacks or broad authorizations causing insider threats. For you it could be a new discovery for certifications like CCNA or CompTIA Network+. Professionals new to WiFi management will appreciate how AAA streamlines compliance (e.g., GDPR or HIPAA) and troubleshooting—accounting logs can pinpoint issues like excessive data usage.

In essence, authentication is the "key to the door", while authorization is the "map inside". Mastering both, especially with some RADIUS tools, empowers you to design networks that are secure, efficient, and user-friendly. If you're starting out, try setting up a FreeRADIUS lab on some virtual machines (and add some proxy with home_servers if you're desperate) — it's a hands-on way to see AAA in action.
