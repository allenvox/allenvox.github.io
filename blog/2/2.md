# **SOLID**ly fill the gaps in your knowledge!

Hey there guys!
<br><br>
Since there is only one month of summer left, I've decided to do some homework and get ready for questions from some job interviews. The one topic that appears almost in every single YouTube video is **the SOLID principles**. Fair enough, I've heard something about them and these are pretty obvious if you're developing software for a while, but let's make it clear for everybody with this small blogpost.

### Here they are, the five P's:

1. The S (Single Responsibility)

A class should have only one reason to change. This means that a class should only have one job or responsibility. By adhering to SRP, you can ensure that your classes are more modular and easier to understand.
<br><br>
*Example*: If you have a `User` class that handles both user data and file operations, split it into two classes: `User` for user data and `UserFileManager` for file operations.
<br><br>

2. The O (Open/Closed)

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
<br><br>
*Example*: Instead of modifying a `Shape` class to add new types of shapes, create a base `Shape` class and extend it with subclasses like `Circle`, `Square`, etc.
<br><br>

3. The L (Liskov Substitution)

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. Essentially, subclasses should behave in a way that doesn't break the functionality of the superclass.
<br><br>
*Example*: If you have a `Bird` class with a `fly()` method, and a `Penguin` subclass, the `Penguin` class should not inherit `fly()` if its use is prohibited. Instead, you can restructure the class hierarchy with e.g. `FlyingBird` and `NotFlyingBird` classes where only the first one will have `fly()` method.
<br><br>

4. The I (Interface Segregation)
   
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means creating specific interfaces for specific needs rather than a single, general-purpose interface.
<br><br>
*Example*: Instead of having a single `Worker` interface with methods like `code()`, `test()`, and `manage()`, create separate interfaces like `Developer`, `Tester`, and `Manager` with their own palettes of methods.
<br><br>

5. The D (Dependency Inversion)
   
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This principle emphasizes decoupling the high-level and low-level components through interfaces or abstract classes.
<br><br>
*Example*: Instead of a `Database` class directly depending on a `MySQLDatabase` implementation, use an interface `IDatabase` that `MySQLDatabase` implements. The `Database` class can then depend on the `IDatabase` interface, making it easier to switch to another database implementation if needed.
<br>

### And so...
Hope this post helped you to understand the five object-oriented design principles (introduced by Robert C. Martin) now named as **the SOLID principles**.
