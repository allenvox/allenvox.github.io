# **Understanding `weak` and `unowned` references in Swift**
###### 11.10.24
Hey everyone!

I’ve been transitioning into iOS development for some time now, and it’s been quite the learning journey so far. One of the interesting concepts I’ve come across recently is how memory management works in Swift, specifically how we deal with references between objects. Let's start from basics and continue to the head topic!

---

### **What Are Strong References?**

Before diving into `weak` and `unowned`, let’s recap strong references — the default type of reference in Swift.

In Swift, whenever we create an instance of a class, it's stored in memory, and every reference to this instance increments a **strong reference count**. When the reference count reaches zero (meaning no one is holding onto the instance anymore), the memory used by that instance is freed up, thanks to **Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)**.

But sometimes, strong references can lead to a big problem: **retain cycles** (also called reference cycles). This happens when two objects hold strong references to each other, meaning they can't be released because each one is keeping the other alive. In such cases, ARC won't be able to free the memory, causing a **memory leak**.

---

### **Introducing Weak and Unowned References**

To avoid retain cycles, Swift provides two alternatives to strong references: **weak** and **unowned**. These are both used to break reference cycles but in slightly different ways, and each has its own use cases.

#### 1. **Weak References**

A **weak** reference does not increase the reference count of an object. When we declare a reference as `weak`, ARC is informed that it should not consider this reference as one that should keep the object alive. This means the object it points to can still be deallocated, even if the weak reference is still around.

The key feature of `weak` references:
- The reference is **optional** (`nil` by default).
- If the referenced object is deallocated, the weak reference automatically becomes `nil`.

##### **When to Use `weak`?**
`weak` is most commonly used when there is a parent-child relationship where the child does not need to strongly hold onto the parent. For example, `delegate` patterns often use `weak` references to avoid retain cycles.

##### **Example: Using `weak` in Delegation**

```swift
class Parent {
    var child: Child?
    
    deinit {
        print("Parent is being deallocated")
    }
}

class Child {
    weak var parent: Parent?  // `weak` avoids retain cycle here
    
    deinit {
        print("Child is being deallocated")
    }
}

var parent: Parent? = Parent()
var child: Child? = Child()

parent?.child = child
child?.parent = parent

parent = nil  // The parent is deallocated, and the weak reference to the parent becomes nil.
child = nil   // The child is deallocated too.
```

Here, if we did not make `parent` weak in the `Child` class, we would create a retain cycle because both `parent` and `child` would hold strong references to each other, preventing deallocation.

#### 2. **Unowned References**

An **unowned** reference also doesn't increase the reference count of the object it refers to, but unlike `weak`, it is **non-optional** and assumes that the object it references will always be valid for the lifetime of the reference.

Because it’s non-optional, **unowned** references are more dangerous to use than `weak`. If the object is deallocated and you try to access the `unowned` reference, it will lead to a **runtime crash**.

##### **When to Use `unowned`?**
Use `unowned` when one object relies on another for its entire lifetime, meaning it expects the object to always exist when accessed, but you still want to avoid a retain cycle. For example, `unowned` is often used when two objects have a close relationship, such as when one object cannot outlive the other.

##### **Example: Using `unowned` in a Strong-Weak Relationship**

```swift
class Person {
    var name: String
    var creditCard: CreditCard?
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
    
    deinit {
        print("\(name) is being deallocated")
    }
}

class CreditCard {
    let number: Int
    unowned let owner: Person  // `unowned` because credit card cannot outlive the person
    
    init(number: Int, owner: Person) {
        self.number = number
        self.owner = owner
    }
    
    deinit {
        print("CreditCard \(number) is being deallocated")
    }
}

var john: Person? = Person(name: "John")
john?.creditCard = CreditCard(number: 1234, owner: john!)
john = nil  // Both `john` and the associated `CreditCard` are deallocated.
```

In this example, `CreditCard` has an `unowned` reference to `Person` because it’s assumed that the credit card cannot exist without its owner. If `Person` is deallocated, the `unowned` reference is valid until the `CreditCard` is also deallocated.

### **Summary — `weak` and `unowned` references**

| Aspect              | `weak`                            | `unowned`                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Reference count     | Does not increase                 | Does not increase                |
| Optional?           | Yes (`nil` when object is deallocated) | No (cannot be `nil`)            |
| Crash possibility?  | No                                | Yes, if accessed after deallocation |
| Use case            | When the reference can be `nil` (e.g., delegate) | When the reference should never be `nil` but still avoid cycles (e.g., owner relationship) |

That’s it for today! Hopefully, this breakdown was helpful for any of you diving into Swift memory management.
