# *Per aspera ad astra* or **Navigating burnout as a Junior**
###### 13.01.25

Starting my first job as a junior developer few months ago felt like stepping into a storm. There’s excitement, sure — you’re finally doing what you’ve been preparing for and getting paid well. But there’s also a whirlwind of doubts, challenges, and emotions that can quickly spiral into burnout if not addressed. In this post I want to share my beginning of worker's journey through the ups and downs, how I dealt with (and sometimes still deal with) feeling overwhelmed, and the tips that could help you move forward.

### The weight of the first job

When I started, I was eager to prove myself. Every task felt monumental, every line of code had to be perfect. Yet, the reality of corporate coding hit me hard. The complexity of the codebase was intimidating. Diving into a project with countless dependencies and layers was like being handed a 1000-page manual in a language you barely understood.

The tasks were often monotonous, requiring hours of digging into documentation/codebase or debugging obscure issues. I kept wondering: is this it? Is this what I signed up for? Fixing some dependencies that didn't install properly, or reverting the firmware to backup, when I made the wrong changes.

On top of that, I struggled with imposter syndrome. Despite working hard, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t good enough and that others were somehow managing better than I was.

All of this took a toll. I found myself procrastinating, zoning out, and, at times, just dreading the workday. Burnout was slowly creeping in.

### The day-to-day reality

A typical day for me started with optimism but often shifted to frustration. I’d spend hours trying to figure out a bug or deciphering legacy code. Some days, I felt like I was just staring blankly at my screen, trying to muster the energy to move forward.

There were moments of joy — solving a tough problem, learning something new, or receiving positive feedback. But they were often fleeting, overshadowed by the pressure to keep up. Lunch breaks and small chats with friends & teammates helped, but they couldn’t fully break the cycle of fatigue.

### What to do?

1. **Shift Your Perspective on Learning**

As a junior, you're not expected to have all the answers. Your job is to learn, ask questions, and grow. If you're spending a lot of time on a task, it doesn't mean you're slow — it means you're figuring things out. Instead of viewing challenges as roadblocks, see them as steps in your professional development. The time you're investing now will make similar tasks easier in the future.

2. **Break Tasks Into Smaller Steps**

Large, complex tasks can feel overwhelming, but breaking them into smaller, manageable chunks makes them more approachable. Start with these questions:

- What is the goal of the task?
- Which part of the codebase is relevant?
- What resources or documentation can help?

Completing even small pieces of a task gives you a sense of progress, which builds momentum and confidence.

3. **Separate Your Self-Worth From Your Work**

It's tempting to tie your sense of value to how quickly you can complete a task or how perfect your solutions are, but this mindset is a fast track to burnout. You are not your pull requests or bug fixes. Every developer — even the most experienced — has moments where they feel stuck. Remember: struggling with code doesn't make you bad at your job; it makes you human.

4. **Ask for Help Without Shame**

No one expects you to know everything. If you're stuck, reach out to your team. Instead of worrying about how you’ll be perceived, approach others with genuine curiosity:

- Explain what you've tried so far.
- Share what you think the problem might be.
- Ask for their insights or suggestions.

Most coworkers will respect you for seeking clarity and learning rather than wasting time spinning your wheels.

5. **Find Joy in Small Wins**

Sometimes, the day-to-day grind of debugging or implementing features can feel monotonous. To counter this, celebrate your small victories — whether it's fixing a tricky bug, understanding a new concept, or successfully using a new tool. Recognizing these moments helps you appreciate how far you've come, even if it feels like progress is slow.
<br><br>

6. **Create Balance Outside of Work**

When work feels overwhelming, having a life outside of it becomes even more important. Cultivate hobbies, spend time with friends and family, or exercise to release stress. A balanced life can help you gain perspective and keep work-related frustrations from taking over your entire mindset.
<br><br>

7. **Focus on What You Can Control**

You can't change how complex the codebase is, how long it takes to onboard, or the occasional frustrating aspects of company processes. But you can control how you approach your work:

- Set realistic daily goals.
- Stay curious and open to learning.
- Take breaks to reset when you're feeling stuck.

By focusing on your efforts rather than outcomes, you'll feel more in control and less burdened by the weight of things outside your influence.
<br><br>

8. **Trust the Process**

Finally, remember that being a Junior is just the beginning. The discomfort you're feeling now is temporary. With time, experience, and persistence, you'll grow into your role, gain confidence, and find your rhythm. Trust that the process of learning and adapting is setting the foundation for a successful career.

### Moving forward

Burnout isn’t a one-time battle; it’s an ongoing challenge that requires awareness and self-compassion. Some days still feel hard, and that’s okay. What matters is that you’re trying, learning, and taking steps to care for yourself along the way.

It's okay to feel overwhelmed — it means you're challenging yourself. But don't let overthinking rob you of the joy of learning and growing. The next time you catch yourself spiraling, take a breath, break things down, and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can. Progress is made one small step at a time.
