# Who is the **Delegate**?
###### 15.10.24
As I dive deeper into iOS development, one of the patterns that stands out in everyday usage is the **Delegate Pattern**. It's commonly used across the UIKit framework, and understanding it can help you write cleaner, more modular code. Let's break it down and understand how it works, why it's important, and how you can use it in your own projects.

### What is the Delegate pattern?

The **delegate pattern** is a design pattern that allows one object to send messages or communicate with another object in a loosely coupled way. In simpler terms, it allows **one object to delegate** responsibility for performing a certain task to another object. 

This pattern is useful because it keeps objects separate and independent, following the **Single Responsibility Principle** from **SOLID** (check the posts below) — each object should only do one thing. By using the delegate pattern, an object can hand off some of its tasks to another object without tightly coupling them.

### How does it work in Swift?

In Swift, the delegate pattern typically involves the following steps:

1. **Define a protocol**: A protocol declares methods that the delegate needs to implement. It sets the rules for communication.
2. **Create a delegate property**: The class that wants to delegate some of its tasks will have a `delegate` property, usually declared as `weak` to avoid retain cycles.
3. **Adopt and implement the protocol**: The object that will act as the delegate adopts the protocol and implements the required methods.

### Example usage

Imagine we are building an app with a `Downloader` class that downloads files from the internet. The `Downloader` doesn't need to know how to handle the result of the download — it can delegate that responsibility to another class, such as a view controller.

Here’s how we can implement this:

#### Step 1: Define a `protocol`

```swift
protocol DownloaderDelegate: AnyObject {
    func didFinishDownloading(_ downloader: Downloader, data: Data)
}
```

We declare a `DownloaderDelegate` protocol that has a method `didFinishDownloading`, which will be called when the download is complete.

#### Step 2: Create a `delegate` property

```swift
class Downloader {
    weak var delegate: DownloaderDelegate? // Delegate property

    func startDownload() {
        // Simulate download
        let data = Data() // Fake downloaded data
        delegate?.didFinishDownloading(self, data: data) // Inform the delegate
    }
}
```

Here, `Downloader` has a `delegate` property of type `DownloaderDelegate`. When the download finishes, it calls the delegate's `didFinishDownloading` method to pass the downloaded data.

#### Step 3: Adopt and implement the protocol

Now, a view controller can act as the delegate and handle the downloaded data.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, DownloaderDelegate {
    let downloader = Downloader()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        downloader.delegate = self // Set the view controller as the delegate
        downloader.startDownload()
    }

    // Implement the delegate method
    func didFinishDownloading(_ downloader: Downloader, data: Data) {
        print("Download finished! Data received.")
        // Handle the downloaded data (e.g., update the UI)
    }
}
```

### Why use the Delegate pattern?

The delegate pattern offers several key benefits:

- **Separation of concerns**: Objects only handle what they're supposed to, without needing to know how other objects work.
- **Flexibility**: The delegating object doesn’t care who its delegate is. It just needs someone to do the work. This makes the code easier to extend and maintain.
- **Reusability**: You can reuse the same object in different contexts by assigning different delegates.

### Where do we see Delegates in Swift?

Delegates are everywhere in iOS development. Some common examples include:

- **UITableViewDelegate**: To handle events when a user interacts with a `UITableView`.
- **UITextFieldDelegate**: To handle text input events in a `UITextField`.
- **CLLocationManagerDelegate**: To respond to location updates from the `CLLocationManager`.

### Conclusion

The **delegate pattern** is an important concept in Swift that allows for clear, maintainable, and flexible code. By breaking down responsibilities and allowing communication between objects without tight coupling, it helps make code easier to read and extend.
