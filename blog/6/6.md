# Durov's digital spaces that shaped us
###### 18.01.25
It’s funny how entire generations can anchor their memories to digital platforms. For some, it’s Facebook circa 2010, a wild west of poke wars and embarrassing status updates. For others, it’s TikTok, a kaleidoscope of 30-second trends. But for my generation, VKontakte (VK) in 2015 and Telegram in 2025 stand out as the virtual worlds where we grew up, connected, and tried to make sense of life.

### The place for everybody

Back in 2015, VK wasn’t just a platform; it was the platform. For teenagers and young adults across post-Soviet spaces (and beyond), it was where everything happened. VK wasn’t just a website we visited occasionally — it was home. Your profile was a curated version of yourself, the music playlists were a reflection of your personality, and the memes… well, they were a language in themselves. We lived in group chats, communities ("publics"), created inside jokes that spiraled into entire subcultures, and bonded over “wall-to-wall” conversations that could span hours.

VK was chaotic, messy, and intimate in a way that feels almost unimaginable now. It wasn’t hyperpolished or algorithm-driven. You stumbled upon things naturally, through friends, communities, or just late-night scrolling. Relationships were formed and ended there. It wasn’t just a tool for communication — it felt alive, breathing with our collective energy. We wore our emotions on our sleeves. Every breakup turned into a change of relationship status; every fleeting thought became a status update. Telegram doesn’t have room for that kind of public oversharing. Instead, it gives us private chats and anonymous channels. It lets us hide parts of ourselves we once shared so freely. Maybe that’s growth, or maybe it’s just a sign of the times.

### So… something shifted.

Fast forward to 2025, and that same sense of community now lives in Telegram. The platform has become the default space for connection, creativity, and yes, procrastination. It’s not just a messaging app anymore; it’s a cultural hub. People build entire ecosystems here — channels with millions of followers, anonymous confession bots, niche meme groups that feel like secret societies. And much like VK once did, Telegram feels alive in a way that no other platform does.

But how did we get here?

### How did our digital lives migrate from one space to another?

Some might say it’s all thanks to Pavel Durov — the visionary who founded VK and then left it, only to create Telegram. Durov has always been a polarizing figure, a tech maverick who built platforms that resonate deeply with people. VK reflected a time when we craved messy, overlapping connections — when we didn’t mind the occasional drama or chaos. Telegram, on the other hand, reflects who we are now: more private, more focused, but still desperate to stay connected.

But it’s not just about the platforms themselves. It’s about us, the users. In 2015, we were teenagers and young adults, figuring out who we were in public spaces. VK was perfect for that — it let us share everything, from the deeply personal to the absurdly funny. Now, in 2025, we’re older. We value our privacy more. We crave smaller, safer spaces where we can talk freely without the weight of constant judgment. Telegram gives us that.

### A safe place?

Another thing that’s worth mentioning is how these platforms reflect the broader cultural shifts of their times. VK existed in a world that was still relatively optimistic about social media. It was about connection, community, and creativity. Telegram exists in a world where we’re more skeptical. We’re aware of the risks — of surveillance, of data leaks, of algorithmic manipulation. Telegram responds to those fears by offering encryption, privacy, and control. It’s a platform built for people who have learned the hard way that the internet isn’t always a safe place.

There’s also something bittersweet about this transition. In VK, we all lived in one big house, where everyone’s doors were open. On Telegram, we’ve moved into smaller apartments, where conversations feel cozier but also a bit more isolated. That’s the trade-off: we’ve gained privacy but lost some of the chaos that made VK so special.

Still, both platforms captured something unique about their respective times. VKontakte in 2015 was about discovery — of music, memes, friendships, and ourselves. Telegram in 2025 is about consolidation — finding your people, building your space, and sharing your thoughts without noise.

### A landing pad.

But here’s the thing: even as the platforms evolve, the core of what we’re doing stays the same. We’re building connections, sharing pieces of ourselves, and searching for meaning in the digital noise. VK gave us one way to do that; Telegram gives us another. Who knows what the next platform will look like? Maybe it’ll combine the chaos of VK with the privacy of Telegram. Maybe it’ll be something entirely new.

What’s clear is that these platforms aren’t just tools. They’re mirrors, reflecting who we are at any given moment. VK captured the energy, chaos, and vulnerability of our youth. Telegram reflects the complexity, caution, and creativity of our present. And somewhere down the line, another platform will come along to capture the next phase of our lives.

For now, though, Telegram is where we’ve landed. It’s not perfect, but it’s ours. And just like VK was a snapshot of who we were in 2015, Telegram is a snapshot of who we are in 2025: a little older, a little wiser, and still trying to make sense of it all.
